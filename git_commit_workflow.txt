# Git Commit and Push Workflow for this Project

This document outlines the reliable method for committing changes to Git, avoiding shell quoting issues.

## Step 1: Stage All Changes

Use `git add .` to stage all new and modified files.

Command:
`git add .`

## Step 2: Create a Temporary Commit Message File

Instead of using the `-m` flag, we will write the commit message to a temporary file to prevent errors.

1. Create a file named `commit_message.txt`.
2. Write your full commit message inside this file.

## Step 3: Commit Using the File

Use the `git commit -F` command to use the message from the file.

Command:
`git commit -F commit_message.txt`

## Step 4: Clean Up the Temporary File

After the commit is successful, delete the temporary file.

Command (Windows):
`del commit_message.txt`

## Step 5: Push to the Remote Repository

Push your changes to the `origin` remote.

Command:
`git push origin master`
